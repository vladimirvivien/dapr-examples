# Building Cloud Native Services with Go + Dapr + Kubernetes
This repository contains examples showing how to build cloud-native services with Go (golang) and Dapr running on Kubernetes.

### What is Dapr?
The Distributed Application Runtime ([Dapr](https://github.com/dapr)) is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project that exposes a set of tools, APIs, and components for creating distributed applications that can be executed in different environmental contexts including: 

* Self-hosted (local, VMs, or bare metal servers),Â 
* Kubernetes 
* Or, cloud provider managed

The examples in this repository assume they are running in a Kubernetes cluster (local or otherwise).
